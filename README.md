# Covid Happiness Analysis

## Hypothesis
Overall Happiness and Covid Deaths have an inversely correlated relationship. Meaning, as Covid Deaths go up, people are less happy and vice versa. 

## Motivation
Over the Covid-19 Pandemic, I have observed people are more on edge, or less happy. In this project, I wanted to see if there was a way to quantify that observation. After looking at many datasets that contain sentiment, I decided to use Yelp's extensive reviews dataset to try to guage the sentiment of the nation in these challenging times. 

## Methodology
Extract sentiment analysis scores of Yelp Reviews and compare to Covid Deaths data over time. 

## Final Chart/Conclusion
